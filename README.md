# Train-Duration-ML-Project
# 🚆 Machine Learning-Based Train Journey Duration Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the Machine Learning Internship program.  
The objective is to predict train journey duration based on route and schedule-related features such as total distance and number of stops.

The system includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, model comparison, and a final interactive prediction interface.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model
Model Used: Linear Regression  

Input Features:
- Total Distance
- Number of Stops  

Target Variable:
- Journey Duration (in hours)

Evaluation Metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Distance has a strong positive relationship with journey duration.
- Number of stops also impacts total duration.
- The improved model (distance + stops) performed better than the basic model.

---

## 🖥️ Interactive UI
The final system includes a Gradio-based user interface where users can:
- Enter distance
- Enter number of stops
- Get predicted journey duration
- View visual representation of prediction
